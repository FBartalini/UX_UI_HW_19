                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Always having to fend for myself, I learned the value of organization and time management, and working frequently in the hospitality sector, I developed a strong collaborative sense that taught me to put personal disagreements aside by focusing on the final product. During the years of study and work no one could have imagined what would happen next and when the 2008 crisis arrived, it forced me to have to rethink myself in a new interpretation, which seven years later brought me to the UK. In these years in which I have naturalized here, I have had to develop a strong flexibility and mental openness to be able to survive in a society so different from mine. I have clearly seen how all things contain a basic ambivalence which makes them both difficulties and opportunities, and I have learned to use them. It's not just about knowing how to use programs or a language, I'm talking about the ability to synthesize knowledge in harmony and the ability to create innovative products from them without distorting their functions and objectives, always respecting the ultimate goal.</p>
